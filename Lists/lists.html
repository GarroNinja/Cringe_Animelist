                The battle to retake Wall Maria begins now! With Eren's new hardening ability, 
                the Scouts are confident they can seal the wall and take back Shiganshina District. 
                If they succeed, Eren can finally unlock the secrets of the basement—and the world.

                Alchemy is bound by this Law of Equivalent Exchange—something the young brothers Edward 
                and Alphonse Elric only realize after attempting human transmutation: the one forbidden 
                act of alchemy. They pay a terrible price for their transgression—Edward loses his left 
                leg, Alphonse his physical body. It is only by the desperate sacrifice of Edward's right 
                arm that he is able to affix Alphonse's soul to a suit of armor.

                Self-proclaimed mad scientist Okabe Rintarou lives in a small room in Akihabara,

                air-headed childhood friend, and Hashida Itaru, an otaku hacker. The three pass the 
                time by tinkering with their latest creation, a "Phone Microwave" that can be controlled
