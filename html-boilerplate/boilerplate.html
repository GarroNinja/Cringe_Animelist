        Unable to hear, speak, or wield a sword, Prince Bojji doesn't seem like a 
        typical heir to the throneâ€”and his kingdom agrees. But his fateful encounter with Kage, a shadow on the ground, gives him his first true friend. The two set off on a grand adventure and, together, form a bond that can overcome any obstacle...even being king.

    <h2>Bojji</h2>
    
        <p>The firstborn prince of the <strong>Bosse Kingdom</strong>.</p>
        <p> 
            Bojji was <strong>born <em>abnormally small, weak,</strong> and deaf</em>. He is a powerless prince who has lived his life under the shadow of his father, the legendary King Bosse. 
            He wants to be the world's greatest king, following his father   
        </p>

        <p>
            Bojji is extremely <strong>hard-working</strong> and <strong>sincere</strong>, and these traits draw people towards him even
             if they can't always understand him.
